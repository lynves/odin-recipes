      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        Pizza is a popular food that is topped with a variety of delectable
        ingredients and has a crispy, golden crust. The mix of fresh dough, rich
        sauce, melted cheese, and toppings is always a winning combination,
        whether of your preference for a classic Margherita, a substantial meat
        lover's pizza, or a veggie-packed pie. You can make your favorite
        pizzeria-style pizza in your own kitchen with a few simple ingredients,
        and making pizza at home allows for infinite personalization. The dough,
        sauce, and cheese are essential components of a delicious pizza. An
        exceptional pizza can be created with a well-seasoned sauce, premium
        mozzarella cheese, and a flawlessly baked dough. The outcome is
        dependably a filling and cozy lunch for any occasion, whether you bake
        it on a pizza stone or in a conventional oven.

      <h3>Steps</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Prepare the oven - Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If using a
            pizza stone, place it in the oven while it heats up.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Roll out the dough - Roll out the pizza dough to the thickness you
            choose on a floured surface. Place the dough onto a pizza stone or
            baking sheet that has been lightly oiled.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Add the sauce - Evenly cover the dough with a thin coating of pizza
            sauce, leaving a thin border for the crust around the edges.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Add the cheese - For added taste, top the sauce with grated Parmesan
            cheese after scattering shredded mozzarella cheese on top.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Top with toppings - Evenly distribute your preferred toppings
            (vegetables, pepperoni, etc.) over the pie.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Bake the pizza - Put the pizza in the oven and bake it for 10 to 12
            minutes, or until the cheese is bubbling and starting to brown and
            the crust is golden brown.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Finish and serve - After taking the pizza out of the oven, lightly
            oil the crust. If desired, garnish with fresh basil or dried
            oregano. Cut and savor!
          </p>
