      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Prepare the Patty - The patties should be cooked on a grill until
            the outside is properly golden brown and the inside is still moist
            and tender. Make sure it's cooked all the way through without going
            overboard.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Toast the Buns - Brush the insides of the top and bottom buns with a
            little butter. On a skillet or grill, toast them till golden and
            just beginning to crisp up.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Assemble the Burger - Cover the bottom bun with a thick layer of the
            secret sauce. Arrange the fresh lettuce on top, then the tomato
            slice and pickles. Layer the onions here as well, if using. Top the
            vegetables with the freshly cooked, hot patties, then the cheese
            slice. To keep everything in place, place the other bun on top and
            gently press.
          </p>

        <li>Serve and ENJOY!!!!!!</li>
