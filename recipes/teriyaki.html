      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        The popular Japanese-inspired dish teriyaki chicken has juicy, delicate
        chicken covered in a savory-sweet glaze made with sake, sugar, mirin,
        and soy sauce. The rich, glossy sauce that gives the chicken its
        distinctive flavor can be brushed over after it has been perfectly
        pan-seared, roasted, or grilled. This dish is a tasty and filling supper
        that is frequently served with steamed rice and veggies.

      <h3>Steps</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Prepare the sauce - The soy sauce, brown sugar, honey, rice vinegar,
            sesame oil, mirin, ginger, and garlic should all be combined in a
            small saucepan. Mix thoroughly to incorporate.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Simmer the sauce - Bring the mixture to a simmer in the saucepan
            over medium heat. Cook, stirring periodically, until the sauce
            thickens slightly and the sugar melts, 3 to 5 minutes.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Cook the chicken - Heat a big skillet or grill pan over medium heat
            while the sauce is boiling. Use salt and pepper to season the
            chicken. The chicken should be cooked through and golden brown after
            5 to 6 minutes on each side of the pan (internal temperature should
            reach 165°F/74°C).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Coat the chicken - Lower the heat to low after the chicken is done.
            After adding the teriyaki sauce, sauté the chicken for a further one
            to two minutes so that the sauce may cover it evenly and caramelize
            a little.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Serve - Serve the Teriyaki chicken over rice and garnish with sesame
            seeds and chopped green onions, if using. Enjoy!
